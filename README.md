# Trivia Survivor
_Author: David O'Gara_

Trivia Survivor is a movie trivia quiz game with an element of danger. Players will test their knowledge of movie trivia as a creature makes its way towards them. Correct answers will stall the creatures approach while incorrect answers will allow it to advance. When too many wrong answers have been submitted the game ends in failure so to survive players must answer enough trivia questions correctly.

## External user goal

Users of the site are invited to test their knowledge of movie trivia in a fun survival quiz where they must answer questions correctly or lose from a limited number of lives.  

## Site owner goal

The goal in creating the site is to provide and entertaining and fun quiz that encourages repeat attempts. A secondary goal of this site is to demonstrate the use of Javascript in creating an interactive application.

## Demo of the Dead

This project began as coursework in Code Institute's Full Stack Software Developer course. I refered to that version of this idea as 'demo of the dead' as the zombie sub-genre was the starting point.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The theme and title chosen reminded me of the the playstation game series 'Resident Evil' so I looked to the the late nineties era titles for inspiration and chose to base the colour palette on the inventory screen (pictured below) from Resident Evil 2 (1998). This includes using green and red in the same manner to represent states of 'fine' and 'danger'.
